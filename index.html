            <p>It's near pixel-perfect in Chrome, so I suggest that's what you view it in.
              Things are slightly off in Firefox, but nothing a little more work couldn't rectify.</p>
            <p>The drop-shadow and gradient in the title aren't quite right, but that's hard to eyeball 
              off just an image. Working off a PSD would get it much more accurate.</p>
            <p>Also, I may be using a slightly different version of Helvetica to you. Hopefully that won't 
              affect it too much.</p>
